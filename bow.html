/// This is code fo the game Battle of Wits a game based on the Book/Movie
//// "The Princess Bride."  In the game You are Wesley aka The Dread Pirate
//// Roberts aka DPR and you have challenged Vizini to a battle of wits
//// to the death!  In this version Vizini will ask three riddles after which
//// DPR will have to identify which of two Goblets contains iocane poison
//// (which as any fool knows is odorless and colorless rendering it indetectable
//// and only comes from Austraila.)  Pay close attention to Vizini's words
//// whetherby arrogance or sloppynes, he's bound to drop clues to the
//// poisoned goblet within his lavish insults.  Don't forget Buttercup is stading by
//// ready to offer a hint or words of encouragement.


/****
 * Rules:
 * - DPR starts with 3 hearts and round 1 begins:
 * -
 * -   Vizini prepares two goblets by drawing 5 attribute per goblet
 * -   Vizini poses his riddle and DPR can do the following:
 * 1: Confidently, respond with a single word answer to the riddle
 * 2: Valliently ask Buttcup for help
 * 3: Stall with banter to try and get a clue from Vizini (could backfire)
 * -   If DPR answers correctly then Vizini will get frustrated and toss 3einsults
 * at DPR.  If the answer is wrong then Vizini will ridicule DPR with 1 insult.
 * -   most other actions will elicit an insult from Vizini
 * * -   After 3 riddles Vizini reveals the goblets displaying a describive
 * paragraph for each goblet.
 * -   DPR chooses either the goblet on the right or the goblet on the left
 * and they drink.
 * -   If Vizini drank the poison then DPR wins
 * -   If DPR drank the the posion he loses 1 heart (iocain resistanse) and
 * you begin another round.
 * -   If DPR runs out of hearts you lose the game.
 * * * Objects:
 * * Deck:
 * Generic class for holding objects and distributing them in a
 * random fashion like a deck of cards.
 * * AutoshuffleDeck:
 * Reshuffles when empty for infinite draws
 * * AttributeCard:
 * Object representing a Goblet attribute. Each attribute card has a
 * fragment deck of different sentances that describe the specific attribute
 * of the goblet in different ways for variation.  There is also an insult
 * deck which provides Vizzini's insults that provide subltle clues to this attriubute.
 * * Attributes are organized into subtypes with exclusive varients (Suite) to avoid
 * creading paradoxacal goblets and to provide templates for the description. For example:
 * * Material:
 * What the goblet is made of. Can be described with sentances like:
 * 'It appears to be crafted from %s',
 * "It looks like it's made from a piece of %s",
 * "It's carved out of %s",
 * "The material looks like %s"
 * * Varients: AncientSilver, Ivory, Jade, Alabaster, White Oak, Cheap Plastic
 * */
